1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I felt that clear naming conventions, organized code with functions and classes, and solid documentation made this project more maintainable and readable. Using a CRUD module simplified working with the MongoDB database. It streamlined operations, made database interactions more abstract and flexible, and promoted reusability by packaging the logic into one modular component. I appreciated how this modularity also improved maintainability, allowing updates to the database schema without affecting other parts of the app. I could easily reuse this CRUD module in future projects needing access to a database similar to the one in this project.

2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them into manageable parts, planning solutions, and iteratively implementing and testing them. This project was different because it involved “real-world” client requirements, which required careful planning and design. In future projects, I would build upon the strategies used here to create efficient and tailored solutions for other client needs.

3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists solve complex problems using computational thinking, developing algorithms, software, and systems that impact various aspects of life. This project helps Grazioso Salvare by providing a centralized, accessible, and efficient way to manage animal data, ultimately improving their ability to identify suitable search-and-rescue candidates and enhance their operations.
